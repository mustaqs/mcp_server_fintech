# Implementation Plan for MCP Fintech Server

This document outlines the implementation plan and development flow for our Model Context Protocol (MCP)-compliant financial technology server. The plan is based on our architecture, backend, frontend, testing requirements, and application flow documentation, as well as the MCP server documentation and Python SDK.

## Project Overview

We are building a comprehensive financial technology platform that integrates secure banking, payment processing, and investment operations into a unified MCP-compliant server. The platform will provide a robust API for fintech companies, developers, financial institutions, and AI agents, with real-time updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE) and advanced security measures.

## Development Phases

Our implementation will follow a phased approach, with each phase building upon the previous one to create a complete, robust system.

### Phase 2: Authentication and User Management (Weeks 3-4)

#### 2.1 Backend Authentication

- [ ] Implement JWT-based authentication
- [ ] Set up role-based access control
- [ ] Configure SAML-based Single Sign-On
- [ ] Implement OAuth2.0/OpenID Connect
- [ ] Create API key authentication for developers

✅ JWT-based authentication: Implemented in backend/app/core/auth.py with functions for generating and validating JWT tokens, including access and refresh tokens.
✅ Role-based access control: Implemented in the User model with a roles field, and integrated with the authentication system in combined_auth.py to validate user permissions based on roles and scopes.
✅ SAML-based Single Sign-On: Implemented in backend/app/core/sso.py and backend/app/api/sso.py with endpoints for SAML login, assertion consumer service, and metadata.
✅ OAuth2.0/OpenID Connect: Implemented in backend/app/core/sso.py and backend/app/api/sso.py with endpoints for OAuth authorization and callback handling.
✅ API key authentication for developers: Implemented in backend/app/db/models/api_key.py, backend/app/core/api_auth.py, and integrated with JWT authentication in combined_auth.py.
✅ Password hashing and security: Implemented in backend/app/core/auth.py using bcrypt for secure password hashing, and in the User model for storing hashed passwords.

## To Do
1.  set up the corresponding IAM role in your AWS account with the appropriate trust relationship to allow GitHub Actions to assume this role. The ARN I used (arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/github-actions-role) is a placeholder that should be replaced with my actual IAM role ARN. - corresponds to ci.yml
